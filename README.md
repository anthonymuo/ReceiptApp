# ReceiptApp
This project used the OpenCV2, images detection, text recognition (tesseract-OCR), rule-base process, mathematical formula, 
and open-source software to recognise and extract information from UK supermarket receipts and store both the required information and 
the original receipt to the database on the user’s device for information and data analysis.

This project and software offer the users the ability to scan or take photos of UK Tesco receipts and get the following done:

·       Get the digital copy saved to the user device

·       The receipt scanned get processed

·       The information on the receipt gets extracted

·       The date and time of transaction saved to the database

·       The name & address of the supplier saved to the database

·       The cost/amount spent saved to the database
